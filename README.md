## Abstract
At European arrival on the Australian continent, sophisticated Indigenous societiespeople practiced land management across the country, including in Australia’s tropical savannas. Fire was one of the main tools people used to manipulate fuel loads and connectivity to reduce uncontrolled wildfire, maintain vegetation structure, and enhance pyrodiversity to maximise resources and minimise risk of larger fires. The time depth over which the profound alteration of ‘natural’ fire regimes to a human-dominated fire regime occurred is unknown. We present a 150,000 year record of climate and vegetation coupled to a record of fire regime derived from three metrics to indicate changes in both (incidence and intensity) derived from three metrics. Rainfall and tree-grass balance varied substantially over the period in response to changes in monsoon intensity and coastline position. We demonstrate a progressive shift in fire regime, beginning 30,000 years ago, from high- to low-intensity fires consistent with a progressive shift to Indigenous control over fire regime that was fully in place by the mid-Holocene. This represents the earliest known example of sustained anthropogenic modification of an ecosystem at a landscape scale by low population density hunter-gatherers. The results imply that major alteration of savannas by human use of fire might date from the Pleistocene in other parts of the world.
